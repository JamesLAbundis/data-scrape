			<p>During February 2014 a series of violent protests broke out ultimately lead to the ousting of Viktor Yanukovych, a strong ally of Vladamir Putin. These events were later to become known as the Maidan Revolution, a movement where the Ukraininan people sought closer ties to Europe. </p>
	
			
			<p>The success of the Maidan Revolution was short lived.
			Russia quickly annexed the Crimean peninsula and supported a rebel uprising in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces of Eastern Ukraine, to keep Ukraine weak and within Moscow's orbit. A covert war between Ukraine and Russia, a war that Russia denies that it is even a part of, soon followed.</p>

			<p>As a part of the Ukrainian conflict, both sides have ramped up propaganda to distort the realities on the battlefield. The Ukraininan conflict is a very sensitive topic for the Russians and Ukrainians with both sides exagerrating the others losses, and under reporting their own during the war. The UN conservatively estimates the death toll to be around 9,115 which includes 2,500 civilians, but I believe the number is much higher. With Russia not officially recognizing that they are at war with Ukraine and hiding their casualties from their own citizens, it is hard to come by casualty counts.</p>

			<p>
			With the information available to the public I have put together interactive graphics that break down the Ukrainian conflict into the most major battles. My data contains several unknowns that I wish to update when more credible information becomes available. I can only be as accurate as my sources and if you feel that the data here is incorrect, then I ask you to post alternative sources below. Please enjoy!
